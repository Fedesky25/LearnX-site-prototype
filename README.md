# LearnX global network site prototype
* All html files in same folder
* All js, css, images in their respective folders
* No dependencies, so no external library that need more HTTP requests and several hundread KB download
* Less template => more unique ;-)
## Doubts / desires
* Side navigation bar: I tried a diferent design from the common, nowdays boring, navigation bar, but there is definitely room for improvements/changes;
* It would be cool to put the SVG of the logo as water mark;
* Not completely sure of header title design on mobile devices.
## Feedback
For now, there is only the landing page (`index.html`), but if you like this design we'll expand it to all other pages.
So, tell me what you think about it
